## Description
Huroofy is an innovative educational application specifically designed to help early childhood in learning Hijaiyah letters. By utilizing advanced Handwriting Recognition technology, Huroofy can classify the shape and variations of children's Hijaiyah writing well, even imperfect writing. Huroofy provides interactive feedback and motivates children to continue learning.

## Summary
This research was created to develop an educational application called Hurofy which is aimed at early childhood education in
learning the Arabic alphabet (Hijaiyah letters). The motivation for creating this application stems from Islamic teachings 
which emphasize the importance of learning and teaching the Koran, especially to children. The target user group includes 
young children learning the letters of the Arabic alphabet and their parents or educators.

Huroofy branding focuses on cultivating young minds letter by letter to shine brighter, symbolized by the logo design and 
colors that represent comfort, softness, enthusiasm and joy. Hurofy's key features include Handwriting Recognition and 
Interactive Feedback to help children learn Arabic letters effectively.

The connection between the application and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) lies in the use of technology for children's 
education, especially in introducing the letters of the Arabic alphabet, which is an important part of the Islamic education curriculum.

The research methodology involved developing Huroofy to classify children's Arabic handwriting using datasets such as Hijja and AHCD. 
Machine learning models, specifically CNNs, will be trained and tested using data from these datasets, with evaluation metrics such as 
accuracy, precision, and recall determining the model's effectiveness.

Technologies used in the development of Huroofy include OpenCV for image processing, Python for programming, TensorFlow for building CNNs 
efficiently, and Keras for machine learning and neural network model development.
